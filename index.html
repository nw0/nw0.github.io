      <p>
        I am a computer security researcher at <a href="https://www.dso.org.sg/">DSO National Laboratories</a>, Singapore.
        My research interests include program representations and transformation, language/architectural compatibility, and usable security &amp; language semantics.

        I completed my MPhil in the <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/comparch/">Computer Architecture Group</a> at the <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk">University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory</a>, under the supervision of <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~swm11/">Prof. Simon Moore</a>.
        During this time I submitted my dissertation <a href="cheri-rust.pdf">Strengthening memory safety in Rust: exploring CHERI capabilities for a safe language</a>, which demonstrated that CHERI hardware capabilities are complementary to and not redundant with the protections offered by the type-safe languages including Rust.

        Previously, my undergraduate thesis, <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/faculty-of-engineering/computing/public/1718-ug-projects/Nicholas-Sim-Optimising-finite-difference-methods-for-PDEs-through-parameterised-time-tiling-in-Devito.pdf">Optimising finite-difference methods for PDEs through parameterised time-tiling in Devito</a>, won the <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing/prospective-students/distinguished-projects/ug-prizes/archive/">Governor's Prize</a> (2017-18) for the <a href="https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/">Department of Computing</a> at Imperial College London.
